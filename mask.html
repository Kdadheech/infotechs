           <h1>Airxom Mask</h1>
           <p>The Airxom mask is a high-tech mask that claims to deactivate viruses, bacteria, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). It was first introduced at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in 2022.</p>

            <h2>Key Features:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Technology:</strong> The mask uses a combination of three technologies to filter and deactivate pollutants:
                    <ul>
                        <li>A mesh fabric traps particles like dust and pollen.</li>
                        <li>Metal nanoparticles threaded into the mask kill bacteria and viruses.</li>
                        <li>A photocatalytic layer uses UVA-activated titanium dioxide to further kill viruses and bacteria. This layer is similar to the technology used in self-cleaning windows.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Reusable:</strong> Unlike disposable masks, the Airxom mask is designed to be reused for up to three years. The company claims that the antiviral properties of the mask will last for this long.</li>
                <li><strong>Weight:</strong> The mask is heavier than a traditional disposable mask, weighing about 160 grams (about a third of a pound).</li>
                <li><strong>Price and Availability:</strong> The mask is expected to be available in late 2023 and will cost around $510 USD.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Considerations:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The mask has not yet been independently tested:</strong> More research is needed to confirm its effectiveness against viruses, bacteria, and VOCs.</li>
                <li><strong>The mask is expensive:</strong> At $510, it is significantly more expensive than disposable masks.</li>
                <li><strong>The mask is heavy:</strong> Some people may find it uncomfortable to wear for long periods.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Overall, the Airxom mask is a promising new technology that could offer superior protection against airborne pollutants. However, more research is needed to confirm its effectiveness, and the high price tag may make it a non-starter for many people.</p>
